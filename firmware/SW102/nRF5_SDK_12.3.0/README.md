# Changes made to the original SDK package

* Set GNU_INSTALL_ROOT and GNU_VERSION in components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.windows
* Patched Makefile.common as proposed in Nordics DevZone Blog [Development with GCC and Eclipse](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/b/getting-started/posts/development-with-gcc-and-eclipse) (at the end of the document, used "makefile.common for SDK 12.2.0 and SDK 13.0.0").
* Added /external_tools ***cmsisconfig*** and ***nrfutils.exe for Windows***.
* Removed examples directory.
