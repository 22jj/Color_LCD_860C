Update for 860C-850C displays, v20.1C.3.
Compatible with TSDZ2-v20.1C.3-860C-NEW.hex firmware motor and also with the previous version TSDZ2-v20.1C.3-860C.hex.

Fixed Wh / km - Wh / mi conversion, now it works.

I added new data to trip A and trip B:
A used Wh
B used Wh
A Wh / km (Wh / mi)
B Wh / km (Wh / mi)
Furthermore, by setting the "automatic reset hours" to zero, with a fully charged battery (SOC 100%), an automatic trip reset is obtained.

Also added the possibility to set the temperature unit of measure independently from SI / Imperial (also SW102).

"Motor fast stop" has been removed as a menu item, but the function is still present, to activate it set Motor deceleration = 100 (also SW102).

Increased maximum battery capacity limit (also SW102).
Fixed other small bugs that I don't list.

The only modification on the motor is the "Startup assist" function, interesting for off-roaders, enabled in the "Startup boost" menu (with SW102 it is always enabled).
It is used to start from a standstill on impossible climbs, you have to press the UP button for two seconds and, keeping it pressed, start pedaling. After starting, release the button.
Warning: the power delivered when the UP button is held down depends on the level of assistance and the thrust on the pedals.

Only with SW102, enabled by default "Config shortcut key" (long M key), quick access to the configuration menu.
The SW102 version has not been tested.

The manual is still to be updated.
